<strong>Hello,</strong></br>
My name is Kus Andriadi and I am proud Indonesian. This is one of my blogs, the articles here will consist of my writings about more tech-related topics. I will write mixed between Bahasa Indonesia or English. For other topics (more non-tech), you can go to [kusandriadi.com](https://kusandriadi.com), hint: most of the articles there, are with Bahasa Indonesia.

The reason behind my two blogs is I want to become more active in writings, with various kinds of topics, not only tech-related. This is one of my ways to becoming a better thinker, eh? what is the correlation between writing and thinking? keep this in mind, <u>to become a good writer, you <b>MUST</b> to read a lot</u>, read to expand your vocabulary, expand your knowledge and adding more points of view. Indirectly, you will be better in thinking, more deep and critical.

Currently, I work at blibli as Development Lead, I have more than 8 years of experience as a developer (or in blibli, we called it SDE - Software Development Engineer). As Developer, most of my experiences are using Spring stack, of course, it is because [Spring](https://spring.io) already becomes “standard” in Java environment.

Besides my daily activities as Developer, I trained regularly in Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) and Judo, I starts training at 2016. in BJJ, I also certified as BJJ fundamental instructor from Alliance BJJ Indonesia. Simple, you have to keep your body healthy to write and/or work properly :D

Regards,</br>
Kus
