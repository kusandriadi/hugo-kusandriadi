This is my first post with Hugo platform, I choose static blogging because want more simplicity when writing article. For your information, I already used WordPress for ten years [here] (https://kusandriadi.com/). I do not have any problem with WordPress blogging, it is run well until now, but I need a more simple way to writing. Adding more WordPress blog could be very overkill, because I do not need any fancy feature ;), just create the file and publish the article.
<!--more-->
I decided to split the blog to give more focus outcomes, [kusandriadi.com](https://kusandriadi.com) will fill by more random articles, for tech-related will focus on this site. Each articles will write mix sometimes with English or Bahasa Indonesia.

Hope I can write more often.

Regards,<br/>
Kus
